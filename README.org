* ox-org2gemlog emacs package

*/!\* Don't install as is, I'm clearly discovering elisp and thus my code might be horribly wrong, so have a look (and create a PR in case you find anything wrong!) before using :).

Simple package to convert an org file into 1 or multiple gemtext (.gmi) files.

Documentation to be written soon-ish, once the package achieve MVP.
